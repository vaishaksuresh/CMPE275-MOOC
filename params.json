The application has 2 different components, A Server and a Client.\r\n2. Each team builds their *own* server and client.\r\n3. Every server provides a base set of services.\r\n4. The URL for the request to these services are agreed upon by everybody.\r\n5. The JSON response+ to this request is also agreed upon by everybody.\r\n6. The servers can provide additional services and the clients are free to use/not use them.\r\n7. Now the clients are interchangeable, as long as the base functions are the only functions used.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
